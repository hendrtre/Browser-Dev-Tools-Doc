# Browser Dev Tools

- In simple terms, the console is a computer terminal that allows users to put in commands and view outputs from resulted inputted commands or status messages. Here is a example of a console from a web browser.

- The console is mostly used for debugging purposes. Console.log is the most used function to interect with javascript based programs. But you can use the console to check for proper arrays, database use, proper counting, etc. (Check the imaage above this statment for a visual reference.)
- A breakpoint is basically a pause point in software development. Breakpoints are stopping points in a program that are put in place for debugging purposes. It allows the users to have places in the program to stop/pause the program to see the curent progress of a certain program to see if it is running properly. The image below the next statement shows an example of a breaking point at line 32. 
- Breakpoints can be used from creative responsive CSS designs to making sure a program is running properly. We can check to see if a simple counting program works with the use of breakpoints. The image below shows an example of a breakpoint that is trying to find out if at line 32 of the code does it recieve data that it is trying to collect.

- Network tab in summary can be used to check the speeds of the network on a particular website. It is a inspections developer tool that is used to find and solve the network issues that can best optimize the websites. It records all network requests so then the user can sort the different properties of the requests. Look at the image below for an example of the network tab from a browser.

- The Elements tab is what I use the most at my current development career because I us this the most in simple development of a website. The element tab informs the user basically what is the exact coding used for what is seen on the website as far as the HTML and CSS codes are concerned. It will only show what is currently being used on the page of a website. Looking at the image below the next statment shows the elements tab from a browser. On the right side of the screen in the elements tab, the upper part shows the HTML code that is being used. While below that in the styles subtab shows the CSS code that is being used on that webpage. 
- The elements tab is mostly used to see what edits could happen to a page's look or do CSS editing on a live browser. Some of the uses of the elements tab is that the user can do breakpionts for debugging purposes. They can also store global variables, copy JS paths, toggle a pseudo-class, adjust the styles, hide/delete elements, and many more things. Looking at the image below is the elements tab that I like to use that most. This shows the HTML, CSS styles, and even the JS that is being used on this particular webpage.

- Kind of already stated in the 3rd and 4th points. 
- In summary, it is a tool that allows assistance in debugging issues by skiping over some functions in the program. If the current line of code contains a function, step over runs that code but then suspends the execution of the function at the first line of code after the called function returns. 
- A watch expression is a expression that is defined by a user to monitor what is in the watch window. When the application enters a break mode the watch expressions will then highlight the selected expression and it will appear in the watch window where the values can be observed.
